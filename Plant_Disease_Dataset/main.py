    ### Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç

    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    **How It Works:**
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    **Why Choose Us?**
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    **Get Started**
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

    ## **About Dataset**
    This dataset is created using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset can be found on GitHub. The dataset consists of around **87,000 RGB images** of healthy and diseased crop leaves categorized into **38 different classes**.

    ### **Dataset Structure**
    - **Train Set**: 70,295 images  
    - **Validation Set**: 17,572 images  
    - **Test Set**: 33 images

    ## **Future Goals**
    
    We are committed to developing an advanced application that leverages technology to enhance plant health management. Our key objectives are:
    
    ### **1. Early Disease Prediction**
    - The application predicts plant diseases **before they occur** by analyzing plant scans and environmental data.
    - Helps farmers take **proactive measures**, reducing crop loss and increasing yield.
    
    ### **2. Automated Health Reports**
    - Generates **detailed health reports every 15 days** after scanning the plant.
    - Provides insights into **plant conditions** to track changes over time.
    
    ### **3. Environmental Data Integration**
    - Considers crucial factors such as **temperature, humidity, and natural conditions**.
    - Ensures **accurate disease prediction** and treatment recommendations.
    
    ### **4. Fertilizer Recommendations**
    - Suggests **suitable fertilizers** based on the detected disease and climate conditions.
    - Helps optimize **plant nutrition**, ensuring healthy growth and improved productivity.
    
    By integrating **technology with agriculture**, our goal is to empower farmers with **data-driven insights**, leading to **sustainable and efficient farming practices**. üöÄüå±
